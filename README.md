This repo will contain an API built using Flask to provide
a number of in-home services. The first planned tooling is
a way to track the progress I make reading books, and some
method of compiling progress and historical stats to basic
reports.

A service will be built to allow the API to persist on any
always-on host (e.g. a Raspberry Pi).
